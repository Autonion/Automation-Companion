## 📖 Overview

**Automation Companion** is an offline-first, cloud-enhanced Android application that empowers users to create powerful automations — from simple gesture macros to complex, multi-app workflows. It leverages **Accessibility Services**, **on-device ML (TFLite + ML Kit)**, **screen capture**, and **system event receivers** to automate virtually anything on your phone, without requiring root access. All core features work entirely on-device; an optional **Cloud API** integration unlocks access to powerful third-party LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, etc.) for higher-intelligence automation tasks.

Think of it as **Tasker meets IFTTT meets RPA** — built natively for modern Android with Jetpack Compose.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Automation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **💬 Omni-Chatbot & AI Integration** | Natural language automation via local LLMs or cloud APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, etc.), Langchain chat memory, RAG knowledge store, and FAQ repository |
| **🤖 Semantic Automation** | Agentic, natural-language → automation conversion with hardware remote capabilities to control desktop agents directly |
| **🎮 Gesture Recording & Playback** | Record taps, swipes, long-presses, scrolls, and text inputs via AccessibilityService and replay them as macros |
| **🔀 Flow Automation** | Visual node-based workflow editor with drag-to-connect edges, conditional branching, and multi-node execution |
| **🧠 Screen Understanding (ML)** | On-device ML-powered screen analysis — OCR text detection, UI element recognition, and image template matching |
| **👁️ Visual Triggers** | Configure screen-capture-based triggers that watch for specific visual patterns and execute actions automatically |

### ⚡ System Context Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **📍 Location** | Geofence-based automations with radius, day-of-week, and time-window filtering |
| **🔋 Battery** | Trigger actions based on battery level thresholds and charging state |
| **⏰ Time of Day** | Schedule automations using exact alarms for precise time-based triggers |
| **📶 Wi-Fi** | React to Wi-Fi connect/disconnect events and specific network names |
| **📱 App Specific** | Per-app automation handlers triggered when specific apps are opened |

### 🛠️ Tools & Utilities

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **🐛 Automation Debugger** | Step-through inspector with categorized logs for every feature module — debug your automations in real time |
| **🌐 Cross-Device Automation** | LAN-based multi-device sync (Phone ↔ PC ↔ Tablet) via local Wi-Fi |
| **📦 Reusable Action System** | Trigger-agnostic actions (SMS, volume, brightness, DnD) shareable across all trigger types |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a **multi-layered modular architecture** with strict separation of concerns:

```
app/src/main/java/com/autonion/automationcompanion/
├── ui/                          # Home screen, navigation, theme, shared components
├── core/                        # Interfaces, models, contracts
├── automation/                  # Shared action system (trigger-agnostic)
│   └── actions/                 # ActionPicker, ActionBuilder, ConfiguredAction
└── features/                    # Feature modules (isolated)
    ├── flow_automation/         # Visual workflow editor + execution engine

    │   ├── wifi/                # Wi-Fi state receiver
    │   └── app_specific/        # Per-app automation handlers
    ├── automation_debugger/     # Runtime log inspector
    ├── cross_device_automation/ # LAN sync engine
    └── settings/                # App preferences
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Offline-First, Cloud-Enhanced** — All core features run on-device with zero cloud dependency; optional Cloud API integration for higher-intelligence LLMs
- **Privacy-Aware** — Cloud API usage requires explicit user consent; API keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM; data goes directly from device to provider — Autonion never collects or forwards any data
- **Modular Features** — Each feature is fully isolated with its own UI, engine, and models
- **Trigger-Agnostic Actions** — Actions (SMS, volume, brightness, DnD) are decoupled from triggers and reusable everywhere
- **MVVM Pattern** — ViewModels manage UI state; clean separation between UI and business logic
- **Accessibility-Powered** — Gesture replay and UI inspection via Android AccessibilityService
